"Developed a Streamlit dashboard integrating UK flood models with property values and social vulnerability indices, using Oasis LMF for stochastic event generation and PySpark for scalable loss aggregation. Incorporated real-time flood data from the Environment Agency API and validated outputs against historical events (e.g., 2015 UK floods). Deployed on AWS Lambda for reinsurer clients, with SHAP visualizations for model explainability and a mock client report summarizing risk mitigation strategies."
- Incorporate Real-Time Data: Add a component that pulls real-time or near-real-time flood data (e.g., from the UK Environment Agency’s Flood API or Copernicus satellite data) to make the dashboard dynamic and more relevant to operational use cases.
- Expand Peril Coverage: While flood modeling is central, consider including windstorm or storm surge data (e.g., from Met Office APIs) to demonstrate versatility across perils.
- Ethical Considerations: Document how you address potential biases in social vulnerability indices (e.g., ensuring fairness in how deprived areas are represented) to align with ethical AI principles.
- Model Validation: Include a validation step comparing your Oasis LMF outputs to historical flood events (e.g., UK floods of 2015 or 2020) to demonstrate rigor.
- Client-Facing Deliverables: Create a mock client report (e.g., a PDF export from the dashboard) summarizing key insights for reinsurers, focusing on actionable outcomes like risk mitigation or pricing strategies.
- Scalability: Since you’re using PySpark, emphasize how the pipeline handles large datasets (e.g., millions of property records) and document performance metrics (e.g., runtime, memory usage).
- Explainability: Use SHAP or LIME to explain key model outputs in the dashboard, addressing regulatory requirements for transparency in AI-driven models.

Dissertation idea:
- deeper exploration of advanced ML techniques (e.g., neural networks for geospatial data, reinforcement learning for decision-making)

Regulatory and Compliance Depth: global standards (e.g., IFRS 17, NAIC RBC, ICS 2.0) and their practical application in CAT
Soft Skills for Consulting: MECE, Pyramid Principle, and client-facing deliverables
Geospatial and Climate Data: further integrate real-time or near-real-time data sources (e.g., Copernicus, Sentinel satellites) to align with cutting-edge industry practices.
Scalability and Big Data: scalable data pipelines (e.g., Kubernetes, Apache Kafka) could prepare you for enterprise-level CAT modeling workflows.
Diversity of Perils: exploring other perils (e.g., windstorm, earthquake, wildfire) could broaden your applicability, especially for global firms like RMS or Swiss Re.
